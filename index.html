		I graduated from McGill University in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Cultural Studies (yes, I got to take classes about Netflix and comic books)!
		While I took a wide variety of CS classes ranging from computer graphics to NLP and ML to digital humanities, I've gotten the pleasure (and sometimes horror) of getting 
		well acquainted with frontend work since beginning my professional career.

		</div class="content">
		I particpated in a yearlong program as an <a href="https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/engres.html">Engineering Resident</a> at the Google Seattle office, which gave me the unique experience of getting to experience multiple teams in a short span of time!
		Since then, I've joined on full time as an engineer in Google Research on an early-staged project focused on improving the language learning experience.

			Other random things about me, in no particular order:
			<ul>
				<li>I now give back to the Engineering Residency program by volunteering as a code mentor for new cohorts of residents.</li>
				<li>I completed a software dev co-op at the Government of Canada.</li>
				<li>I am completely bilingual in French and English. Mais ne me posez aucune question technique de codage en français, s'il vous plaît!</li>
				<li>I was a teaching assistant at <a href="https://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/">Digital Media Academy</a>, where I helped teach a python game programming course, and a Lego EV3 robotics course to kids aged 9-17. This role kickstarted my interest in making tech accessible to all kids from an early age!</li>
				<li>I was a competitive figure skater for years, and then went on to skate for the McGill Skating Team (check out my now long-gone flexibility and skills <a href="https://youtu.be/1OOirn9X_Js">here<a>). </li>
			</ul>

			When I'm not working, I spend most of my time at the pottery studio, at the gym, reading recipe blogs, watering my plants, and watching endless thift flip videos on youTube.
